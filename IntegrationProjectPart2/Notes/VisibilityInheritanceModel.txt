LO2a. There are three types of visibility modes known as access specifiers in OOP:

1. Public
2. Protected
3. Private

The public access specifier is visible to everything, which means that any class can use those variables.
The protected access specifier is visible onle to the derived class, which means only dervied classdes can access these variables.
The private access specificer is not visible to any other class, meaning that even the derived class cannot use these variables.
